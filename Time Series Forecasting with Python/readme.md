# Time Series Forecasting Models

A project for time series forecasting of data in Python, based on a random CSV dataset. We use the RNN Architecture of LSTM for the project which uses the sequence of variable lengths to predict the future data values.


## Major Libraries Used:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn



## Implementation

To implement this project:

```bash
  Load the dataset
  Install the libraries globally or locally for the project
  You may select the specific values for the date variables or may run the code as it is
```
