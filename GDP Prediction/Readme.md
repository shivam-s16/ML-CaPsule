**GDP Prediction Model**

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/rutikbhoyar/gdp-prediction-dataset

4 different learning regressors **(Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradiant Boosting)** were tested to predict GDP, and the best prediction performance was seen in the order : \
\
**Random Forest > Gradiant Boosting > Linear Regression > SVM**

The Metrics for the best prediction performance using Random Forest regressor, using all features in the dataset is:

1. MAE: 2125.24
2. RMSE: 3051.71
3. R2_Score:  0.8873
